		  Harris Paspallis is a Cypriot artist based in Cyprus. He was born in Paphos in 1977. He graduated from the
		  School of Fine Arts (1997-2002), in Athens, Greece, under the supervision of T. Patraskides and
		  D.Mitaras. His work is based on the concept of change. Earth, nature, and man’s respect of the
		  environment is his main theme which investigated through the ways humanity can change or even
		  destroy mother nature with wars, violence and envy. In order to achieve this goal, Haris is trying to
		  invent new ways to bring his artwork into life . He has a unique process of achieving this as he takes
		  examples from his own experiences. The artist has started a journey of experimentation with multiple
		  media, different textures, earthy colours which transmit his message to the viewer in a most dynamic
		  and penetrative manner, portraying vividly nature’s wildness.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		  An abstract work, emitting realistic messages that can be sent to the audience in order to bring about
		  appreciation of nature and awareness of the importance of life, a “catharsis" and a way out to a common
		  past and future that looks “the same, endless, untouched".
	  </p>
	  <p>
		  Besides having participated in several solo and group exhibitions in Cyprus, Greece, Italy, Russia, United
		  Kingdom, Vienna, Romania, Moldova, France, Andorra, Finland, Spain, Brazil and Hungary as an active
		  artist, he represented Cyprus in the international painting Biennale of Chisinau, Moldova (2013)and the
		  2nd Biennale of Santorini, “Peace Mechanics” Greece(July 2014)where with his team were awarded the
		  first prize.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		  Two of his sculptural installations made of marble,”Views of infinity” and “The Emergence of Aphrodite”
		  are placed in Kato Paphos near the lighthouse and at the ex Kennedy square in the centre of Paphos.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		  Accordingly a significant number of paintings and installations are displayed in public and private
		  collections in Cyprus and abroad.
