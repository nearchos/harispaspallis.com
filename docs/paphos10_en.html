Layered fabrics, used clothes, torn trousers and shirts, hang form the ceiling like dried animal skins, painted white, in a symbolic act of purification, signifying the adventures, undergone by both flesh and soul, in search of a liberating catharsis. This is entailed in the risky and crucial question whether to keep your individuality or to abolish it and merge with the crowd; to remain who you are born, meant or expected to be or to change into what you really want to become; to move into unknown territories of the body and mind or to stay  in the familiar homeland of conformity and safety? To take the risk of a painful transformation leading to rejuvenation, light and truth or to hide behind dark and stifling barriers of mental and physical imprisonment and stagnation?
To risk is to suffer a fragmentation of the psyche, to allow it appear denuded and exposed like the hanging remains of butchered animals, in order to be able to detect and collect its scattered pieces, memories and experiences and, by reassembling them, to redefine your personal and collective identity through a harsh, penetrative plunge into the concepts of being and belonging.

Viewed from a different perspective, fabrics and clothes, float in the air like heavy clouds, pouring a  forceful rain that sweeps borderlines between ego and id away, overflooding rivers and seas and drowning, in their depths, little everyday deaths of self-denial and self-abnegation, since, after all, to risk is to be brave enough to die only once in a lifetime.

Haris Paspallis' work is an assimilation of images from the deluge of mass media that are so predominantly a part of our contemporary society. By using the media's powerful ability to communicate he reassembles the images so as the resultant pieces question accepted beliefs and redefine one's personal and collective identity and his desire of being and belonging. Whether to keep his individuality or to abolish it and merge with the crowd; to remain as he is born, meant or expected to be, or to change into what he really wants to become; to move into unknown territories of the body and mind or to stay in the familiar homeland of conformity and safety; to take the risk of a painful transformation leading to rejuvenation, light and truth, or to hide behind dark and stifling barriers of mental and physical imprisonment and stagnation.
